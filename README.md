# MissingPeopleLocator
Built an application to report missing people, and maintained a volatile database. A potential missing person could be found by 
matching uploaded images using face recognition, with an accuracy of 95%

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide an innovative solution to the 
problem of finding people, especially children, who go missing. Police come 
across several challenges while investigating a missing person case. This 
project can be used as an important tool by the police and cyber cell to 
locate a missing person. Furthermore, this application allows the general 
public to help in the investigation by uploading image which can then be 
matched in the existing database
The application can be used to report missing people, and find potential 
missing person and their details from the missing person database.
The agenda is to match potential missing people from a database is to 
identify and locate persons who have been reported as lost, kidnapped, 
trafficked, or otherwise unaccounted for. The system uses a biometric 
software application that compares and analyzes the facial features and 
contours of a person in an image with the profiles stored in the database. 
The system also performs a manual verification process by qualified and 
experienced officers to confirm the results of the automated system. The 
system aims to reduce the time and effort required to find missing people 
and to provide accurate and reliable information to the authorities and the 
public.
## About AI technique
### Face recognition:
Face recognition technology is becoming increasingly popular across the 
globe, with its applications ranging from security and surveillance to 
marketing and advertising. Despite its popularity, there are valid concerns 
surrounding its use, including issues of privacy, accuracy, and bias.
At its core, face recognition technology works by using algorithms to 
analyze and identify unique features of a person's face, such as the 
distance between their eyes or the shape of their nose. This data is then 
compared to a database of pre-existing images to determine a match. 
While this technology has the potential to be incredibly powerful and 
effective, there are still a number of challenges that must be addressed 
before it can be widely adopted.

One of the most pressing concerns surrounding face recognition 
technology is its potential for erroneous identification. Studies have shown 
that these systems can be prone to errors, particularly when dealing with 
people of different races or ages. In addition, there have been numerous 
reports of innocent people being falsely accused or arrested based on 
flawed face recognition matches. To address these issues, there are 
ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy of these systems through better 
training data and more robust algorithms.

Another major concern relates to the privacy implications of face 
recognition technology. As these systems become more widespread, there 
are fears that they may be used to track individuals without their 
knowledge or consent. In addition, there are concerns that these systems 
may be used to discriminate against certain groups, such as minorities, 
based on the data they generate. To address these concerns, there are 
ongoing debates about the need for clear regulations and guidelines 
around the use of these systems, as well as the importance of informed 
consent and transparency.

Despite these challenges, there are also many potential benefits to be 
gained from the use of face recognition technology. For example, it has 
already been used to great effect in the field of security, helping to prevent 
crimes and identify suspects. It has also been used in healthcare to help 
diagnose and treat diseases, and in marketing to identify consumer 
preferences and behavior. However, it is important that these benefits are 
carefully weighed against the potential risks and that responsible use of 
this technology is prioritized.

In conclusion, face recognition technology is a powerful tool with a broad 
range of applications and potential benefits, but one that is accompanied 
by significant challenges and concerns. Addressing these challenges will 
require ongoing research and development, as well as careful 
consideration of the ethical and legal implications of its use. Ultimately, if 
these issues can be successfully addressed, face recognition technology 
has the potential to transform the way we live and work in the 21st 
century.

## Conclusion
The project to find missing people using face recognition has been a 
success. The system has been able to identify missing persons with a high 
degree of accuracy, and could be used to reunite many families. The 
project was successful in identifying and locating several missing persons, 
as well as providing valuable insights into the challenges and limitations of 
the face recognition technique. The project also demonstrated the 
potential of using face recognition technique for other applications, such 
as security, verification, and identification.
The system works by comparing the facial features of a missing person to 
the facial features of people in a database of reported missing persons. The 
facial features are extracted from the images using a face recognition 
algorithm.
Once the facial features have been extracted, they are compared to the 
facial features of people in the database. The comparison is done using a 
distance metric. The distance metric measures the similarity between two 
sets of facial features. If the distance between the two sets of facial 
features is below a certain threshold, then the system concludes that the 
two faces are a match.
The system is quite effective and has the potential to be a powerful tool 
for finding missing people. With more developments, the accuracy and 
speed of the system will improve. This will make it even more effective at 
finding missing persons and reuniting families.
The following recommendations are made for the future development of 
the system:
- The system should be expanded to include a larger database of 
reported missing persons. This will increase the chances of finding a 
match for a missing person.
41
- The system should be made more user-friendly. This will make it 
easier for people to report missing persons and for law enforcement 
to use the system.
- The system should be integrated with other law enforcement 
databases. This will allow the system to access more information 
about missing persons, which will improve the accuracy of the 
matches.

The system has the potential to be a powerful tool for finding missing 
people. With further development, the system can become even more 
effective at reuniting families.
